<h1>Shoulder Shrug Detection</h1>

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](<insert link here>)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to detect shoulder shrugging movements in a video captured using Python and OpenCV. It employs face detection techniques to locate the head and then detects shoulder positions relative to the head to determine shoulder shrugging events.

Files used:
1. shoulder_shrug_detection.py - Python script containing the shoulder shrug detection system.

Code Sources:
1. OpenCV documentation: https://docs.opencv.org/
2. NumPy documentation: https://numpy.org/doc/

Instructions:
1. Run the shoulder_shrug_detection.py script.
2. Ensure that the video file used adheres to the specified criteria (max. duration of 1 minute, smooth uncluttered background, visible upper body, head, and shoulders).
3. The detected head region will be marked with rectangles, while the detected shoulder lines will be displayed in red.
4. The intensity of shoulder shrugging events will be classified and indicated with text superimposed on the frames.
